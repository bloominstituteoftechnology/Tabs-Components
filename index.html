						Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not
						again. Many
						people have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more
						about the
						nature of the Universe than we do now.

					<div class="tabs-item-description">
						It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because there is an infinite amount of space for
						them to
						be in. However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite number of inhabited worlds.
						Any finite
						number divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the planets
						in the Universe
						can be said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any
						people
						you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a deranged imagination.

						There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here,
						it will
						instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There is another theory
						which states
						that this has already happened.

						A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.
